						Belief Trap
					</a>
				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 Say you believe that God exists, and he&#39;s testing your faith. If you find some dinosaur bones that suggest the universe existed before 6000 years ago do you no longer believe in God, or does this confirm the belief that God is testing you? In this post I will discuss Belief Traps, internally consitent views of the world from you can&#39;t logically escape.

 This is a counter argument to The Guardian&#39;s article on

  Meme Warfare
 </a>
 , the usage of memes to advance one&#39;s personal beliefs, sometimes dishonestly, into the public discussion. I counter the argument by likening meme warfare to cutthroat competitive business practices.

						Limiting Users to Reward Them

				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 Starting with StackOverflow as an example of a network that limits its users to their benefit, we move on to look at several more examples, discuss allowing the reward to the traded for money, then suggest a handful of networks that could be improved in this fashion.

 I examine the network effect, how examples of networks exploit it, examples that don&#39;t, and suggest we ought to care if our networks are open.

 In reading
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">
  Antifragile
 </a>
 it&#39;s seemed that the concept relates to software and programming in many ways, including language design, testing, bug bounties and project management.

						A Book I'd Like to Read: Evolution Wars

				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 I was reading about
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber-toothed_cat#Biology">
  Saber-toothed cats
 </a>
 , as you do, and was interested in how saber tooths were a case of convergent evolution, and one cat would typically fill the hole left by a previously extinct saber tooth predecessor. It makes growing saber teeth seem like a strategy, which in a co-evolution context has positive and negative trade offs. The sequence of strategies employed by species against each other sound like they&#39;d make an interesting book. So I&#39;d like to describe in a little more detail what I&#39;d like in the book.

 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">
  Pareto Efficiency
 </a>
 is a notion that&#39;s helpful in discriminating between different allocations of resources. Political discussions are typically about moral stances and resource allocations, many of which are trade offs, e.g. coal miner jobs versus climate change. As such, terminology from the notion of Pareto Efficiency are well suited for discussing and reasoning about political dilemmas..

						Review to View

				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 Aggregator sites like reddit and hackernews are a valuable feature of the internet. They provide a single location for a reader to find all sorts of news articles on the web. One thing they do poorly, however, is provide a valuable signal to noise ratio. In this article I propose a crowd sourced technique for improving that which I call Review to View.

						Publicly Traded Employees

				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 Publicly trading companies allows the market better invest in them. This allows a company to more readily raise investments and creates price signals regarding the relative worth of companies. What if we could do the same for employees? Should we do the same employees? I think it could potentially help fund education and is worth consideration.

				<p class="abstract">
 Gaining a critical mass of users for a web-app is incredibly difficult. Many good web-apps likely die as infants before they&#39;ve truely had the chance to demonstrate their worth. I propose commodotising test users to make reaching that critical mass less ruled by chance.
