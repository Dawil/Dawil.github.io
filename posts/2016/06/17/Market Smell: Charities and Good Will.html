		<h1> Market Smell: Charities and Good Will </h1>
		<p class=abstract>I think that business models relying on good will or charity are a market smell and  where possible should be replaced with better business models. As economics or entrepreneurs we should not be content with a charity to solve a problem until we can honestly say we've exhausted every other possibility (or admit we are making a compromise in the name of pragmatism).</p>

<p>That's not to say I think we should get rid of existing charities, just that it's a symptom of an inefficient market. Wikipedia relies on donations instead of ads so that they can maintain their integrity. I agree that their integrity is important but so are the principles of capitalism. Relying on good will is a tax on kindness and generosity and doesn't incentivise the quality of information on wikipedia but rather their ability to plead to a possible donor's emotions.</p>
