		<h1> A Conversation with Dan </h1>
		<p class=abstract>A summary of a discussion I had with my housemate on Job-pocalypse.</p>

<p>I think my relationship with my housemate Dan is unusual. We spend as much as months at a time never seeing each other's faces interspersed with infrequent hours-long conversations on matters that we have much to say. Today we had a conversation on Job-pocalypse that I think was fruitful so I'm writing a summary of it here.</p>

<h3>Job-pocalypse</h3>

<p>Job-pocalypse is the prophesised end of Real Work. Real Work is in contrast to Busy Work, which is fake work designed to keep people busy. For any system in which people are being rewarded in exchange for Busy Work you could just as easily, if not more easily, reward them for nothing. Universal Basic Income is a commonly proposed implementation of this, whereby everyone is given an unconditional minimum living wage.</p>

<p>Easily more than half of our conversation was spent debating whether or not Job-pocalypse is coming prior to the arrival of a General Intelligence. A General Intelligence is effectively an artificial mind, capable of at least any thought that a human mind is capable of. Assuming the cost of producing and selling a General Intelligence goes down with time, as with any capitalist product, any and all humans could possibly be unable to compete with the cheapest of General Intelligences, thus pushing humans out of the Real Work economy. There would be no work a human could offer that a General Intelligence couldn't also offer cheaper. This is Job-pocalypse, the end of jobs.</p>

<p>Since discussing General Intelligences in detail would require understanding Intelligence, something which neither of us can honestly claim, the conversation stuck strictly to <em>before</em> the arrival of General Intelligence. The conversation centred around the question, "Will a growing number of people be priced out of the labor market by technological automation?". Dan took the position that they would, and I took the position of being sceptical.</p>

<p>As I said, easily more than half the conversation was stuck on this point. Some points in favour were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Prior to the invention of engines humans were born with the inately valuable trait of being able to perform physical labor. After the invention and development of engines physical labor was no longer a resource a human would be born with that would sell at a minimum of a living wage on the market.</li>
	<li>Computers are doing to mental labor what engines have been doing to physical labor. It seems that eventually humans will no longer be born with mental labor that sells on the market at a minimum of a living wage.</li>
	<li>The combination of automated physical labor and automated mental labor will result in a net decrease in available Real Work that can be done by humans. A diminishingly number of highly trained intelligent humans will provide an increasingly large percentage of the Real Work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some points against were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Non-general Intelligences may be able to out perform humans in particular games or settings, but they are unable to identify the game itself. For every task that a Non-general Intelligence is performing better than humans at in, a human had to set up the Non-general Intelligence in the first place.</p>
	<li>One of the core strengths of a capitalist economy over a planned economy is that locals to a domain in the economy have greater information than the central planners. Thus the locals will always have a competitive advantage over the central planners. Since a centralizing trend in the supply of Real Work would converge asymptotically to a Centrally Planned economy, an equilibrium might be reached where the locals retain their competitiveness.</li>
	<li>These two points would mean that prior to the advent of a General Intelligence humans would still be born with the unique trait of being able to identify problems that needed solving. Even if computers could solve those problems better, identifying those problems themselves would still remain Real Work that humans could accomplish.</li>
</ul>

<p>We both remained unconvinced of the other's arguments.</p>

<h3>To Conclude an Argument you need a Model; To win a game you need rules</h3>

<p>Let's say there is a jump ramp with a ball at the top and I ask you "How far will the ball fly off the ramp?". If you are unable to perform the experiment and see, in order to convince me you have to provide a model with a framework for discussing the problem. You then would express my question in the model, complete your argument using only moves that are allowed by the model, reaching a conclusion. I would then trust that conclusion to the same extent that I trust that model.</p>

<p>The problem was we were discussing reality, not a model of reality. We had unlimited capacity to disagree because we were arguing assumptions (will job-pocalypse arrive) without a framework to analyse arguments put forth.</p>

<h3>A Model</h3>

<p>Technology causes automation. Engines, computers, algorithms, vehicles, etc are all technology.</p>

<p>Capital can own technology. If I have money I can buy technology.</p>

<p>Access to technology is access to competitiveness (in an automation era). I may not have physical labor or mental labor I can sell for services, but if I have a fleet of self-driving cars I can rent them out. I can even buy a self-farming plot of land and become independent and self-sustained.</p>

<p>Thomas Piketty argues that r &gt; g; that the net rate of return to capital exceeds the growth rate of output and as a consequence wealth inequality will increase. Increasing wealth inequality means that wealth will centralize.</p>

<p>The consequence of this is that access to technolgy will centralize. The share of those that are un-competitive will increase as centralization of wealth, technology and ownership of automation increases.</p>

<h3>It's all over, Rover</h3>

<p>So is that it? It looks like if r &gt; g then it might be it for the uncompetitive labor within that economy. The uncompetitive labor wont have anything to offer those with Capital. So do they just die from starvation, then? Three solutions were discussed.</p>

<h4>Separation</h4>

<p>Well consider rural USA. Let's say that urban USA owns enough capital to no longer need anything from rural USA. This simply means that the rural and urban economies become distinct. Urban USA will not have any desire to import from rural USA, nor will rural USA have anything that urban USA desires to exchange for exports. But rural USA is a rich and fertile land that can self-sustain itself. It can farm enough to feed its citizens, so no, they wont all just die from starvation. Or at least, there is an avenue of escape.</p>

<p>Already rural USA has extreme cases of poverty. If urban and rural USA truely deserve to be distinct economies then it would be best if they had distinct currencies. But this is details.</p>

<h4>UBI</h4>

<p>UBI promises an unconditional minimum living wage to all citizens. Even if wealth centralizes the minimum a person has will still be, at worst, adequate.</p>

<h4>R &lt; G</h4>

<p>We have policies in place to keep inflation at 2%. Could we also have policies in place to keep r &lt; g? In this scenario wealth inequality would decrease, access to technology would decentralize, everyone would retain access to competitiveness and UBI or Separation of economies would be unnecessary.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>We didn't get much time to discuss the solutions in depth. I would like to explore them futher.</p>

<p>We also didn't discuss at all the political feasibility of any of these solutions. This is obviously important.</p>

<p>I would also like to highlight that creating a framework should be considered a requisite for debate. We spent most of our time running in circles because there was no explicit criteria for convincing the other person.</p>
