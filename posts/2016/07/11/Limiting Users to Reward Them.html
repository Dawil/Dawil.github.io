		<h1> Limiting Users to Reward Them </h1>
		<p class=abstract>Starting with StackOverflow as an example of a network that limits its users to their benefit, we move on to look at several more examples, discuss allowing the reward to the traded for money, then suggest a handful of networks that could be improved in this fashion.</p>

<p>In the previous post I mentioned how I thought achieving network plurality is simply a manner of standardising things. Once the necessary innovation phase has cooled down form a committe or converge on the de-facto standard. However you get it, once things have been standardised you'll now be able to use multiple clients or providers or whatever the network requires.</p>

<p>However finding ways to reward users for their contributions to digital web app networks was not as simple. The only example I provided was Stack Overflow providing increased privileges to reputable users. From that I have a hunch that in order to reward your users you have to first restrict them. I'd like to explore that here.</p>

<h3>Stack Overflow</h3>

<p>Consider if StackOverflow didn't restrict it's users. From the moment a person created an account they could upvote, downvote, ask questions, use more than 5 tags, merge tags, edit other people's questions and answers, close questions as not constructive and so on. It'd be chaos. When wikipedia first came out many people thought it could never work because it'd be that kind of chaos. But StackOverflow requires you to earn those privileges through a collection of achievements and community participation. The more you put in to StackOverflow, the more StackOverflow lets you put in to it, or the more power it gives you.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Are there any more examples?</p>

<p>Torrent seed networks are an example of a network that rewards you for contributing. A Torrent seed network restricts access to torrents to users without a significantly high seeding to leeching ratio. By doing so the network changes the Incentive Compatibility so that the best thing to do for a person who wants to download lots of things is to seed lots of things as well.</p>

<p>AirBnB and Uber somewhat fit this category. The difference is instead of the web app designers specifying how much power users have, they let other users decide. If an AirBnB host adds to the network by being a good host to the network's guests, the guests will reward the host with good reviews, allowing the host get more reliable business. It's similar with Uber although not as much. People aren't going to pay more for a good conversationist for a driver.</p>

<p>Another example is Facebook and LinkedIn, surprisingly. If you're friendly to your friends, that'll make it easier for you to befriend their friends, and so on, growing your network. This is valuable because you can now access a larger number of people. This is particularly important for LinkedIn where a larger network can mean better job opportunities.</p>

<p>In each of these examples we can see how the networks were improved by restricting the privileges of their users, and rewarding them for good behavior. In much the same way that profits and losses reward good companies allocating resources to where they'll be most efficient, rewarding and punishing users for their behavior improves the efficiency of the network.</p>

<h3>Fungibility and Commoditising Network Contributions</h3>

<p>In my previous post I mentioned that the Network Effect is the effect a user has on the network, usually referring to their positive effect. Above we say that rewarding a user for that effect is in many cases better for the network as a whole than just giving all users all privileges. But what if we let the user sell or trade their reward?</p>

<p>I believe this is a powerful and significant idea. The ability to trade something enables specialization. Consider one of the rewards StackOverflow gives it's users: bounties. If you contribute to the StackOverflow network you get "points". These points can be used as bounties on a particular question. If the question gets an accepted answer those points are transfered to the answered. This increases the incentive for the answerer as they get increased privileges. Essentially StackOverflow is crowdsourcing the value signalling to its users that it trusts.</p>

<p>But say you could trade those points, sell them to the highest bidder. How would that effect StackOverflow? It would allow specialization. A person who was good at answering questions could sell the points they earned for bread. People with money and questions but not time could then buy the points to incentivize answers to their question. We've turned the StackOverflow platform into a job provider.</p>

<p>You may be aware that this question has been asked before and the consensus was that it <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/270795/is-it-legitimate-to-buy-stack-overflow-reputation">would be bad</a>, but as you can see I disagree. The accepted answer for why it would be bad discusses how Rep points can be used to signal to employers the value of a potential hire, and that Rep points are used to give other StackOverflow privileges like editing and curating posts. I agree, you can't buy reputation, so why should StackOverflow try to allow that? However this is using StackOverflows Rep points for two orthogonal purposes. If you separated them into Bounty Points and Rep points the problem would go away, I believe.</p>

<h3>Possible Applications to Other Networks</h3>

<p>What are some examples of imposing limitations for the benefit of the network, that could also be commodotized? That is, network effects from users that can be rewarded and traded? As we saw with StackOverflow, not all rewards ought to be traded, specifically rewards relating to trust. But rewards relating to time and/or money can.</p>

<p>Well Reddit could limit its users by not showing them the highest voted content. And it could reward them for worthy curation of content by revealing the highest voted content. A curator could then sell their reward allowing someone with money but not time to pay to see the highest rated content. This works for valuable information like news, and investigative journalism, but not so much for entertainment, like cute cat pictures. By enabling this specialization we've turned Reddit into a job platform for content curators who can spend their full time curating, providing context and fact checking articles submitted to reddit.</p>

<p>Multiplayer games often have problems with community behavior. It's well known that if you play a game like Dota (a 5v5 online PC game) you'd best be prepared to get cussed at by angry people. They might ragequit from a game they think is going badly or taunt you so that you want to ragequit. You could change this by letting players vote on whether they enjoyed playing with those people at the end of a game, a simple thumbs up or thumbs down for the nice or mean people. You can then restrict and reward players by only letting the nice people play with the nice people. Now if you're fed up with playing with miserable people, all you have to do is be positive for several games and eventually you'll be surrounded by much more positive people. You could experiment with allowing people to pay to skip the part where they play against a bunch of angry people but as with StackOverflow you have to be very careful with that. You don't want to ruin it for the people who played nice by surrounding them with rich mean people.</p>

<p>You could do this for writing groups for wannabe authors. The more stories I read, curate and provide constructive feedback on the more people I get to show my own writing to. You could again enable specialization here with people trading priority to be placed in front of editors and to essentially commoditize feedback. We could finally begin to organize that massive pile of self-published Amazon books.</p>

<p>And the final example I'll provide is peer-reviewed science articles. Basically taking captcha, and applying it to science journals. If I want my paper to be published in a journal, I have to peer-review or perform replication studies. With specialization we can monetize the verification and scale things up. You might say that peer-review is different, we need carefully and selected individuals to do it. I would say that wikipedia and StackOverflow are the two highest quality sources of information on the internet.</p>

<p>Are there any examples you can think of, of networks that could be improved by limiting and rewarding the users?</p>
