			Market Smells

		<p class="abstract">I've been thinking for a while now that there are similarities between economics and programming. One more similarity that I want to write about is market code smells.</p>

<h3>Code Smells</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">Code smells</a> are things that are considered bad but not in a moral way. They are also not necessarily wrong, but you still often want to minimize them.</p>

<h3>Value Captured should come from Value Created</h3>

<p>The market smell that made we make the connection to code smells was that of poorly sourced revenue.</p>

<p>When you create a business that creates and provides value for other people, you then capture value (money) in some way to make the business profitable. If you have a lemonade stall you're providing lemonade to people at a greater convenience than if they'd made it themselves. You get paid per drink you sell. This is good because the value you capture is related to the value you provide. If you provide more value than a competing lemonade stall (sell more drinks) or do it more efficiently (at lower price with competitive profit margins) then the market rewards you for your performance. In theory, if you keep excelling at selling drinks to people you'll one day become Coca Cola.</p>

<p>However if you're a news company that profits from advertisments things aren't so great. You're rewarded not by the quality of the news you provide, whether by timeliness or insight, but instead by the amount of people that click on your ads. Thus the market rewards you for creating news articles that attract people more likely to click on ads or for quantity of viewers. It is my opinion that the quality of news today is bad and that this is the reason.</p>

<p>There's a whole tangent I could go off on about this topic but I'll limit it to this: the so-called "Digital Age" doesn't yet have a robust way to sell information, given that information can be freely duplicated. I am excited by the potential of <a href="https://launch.blendle.com/">Blendle</a> but it is too early to call it a success yet.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Returning to the topic, I think this principle, that value captured should come from value created, should be a focal point of the design of any business model. This is increasingly important as value creation systems become ever more complex. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A high speed rail system from Sydney to Melbourne might create plenty of value in businesses in both cities but if you try to pay for it using only passenger tickets you'll likely calculate it to be a net loss. If you could sensibly source revenue from businesses that benefit from the increased transport you'd be able to lower the ticket price, increasing the number of passengers, increasing the value created, and hopefully making the whole venture more feasible than it would otherwise be.</li>
	<li>An educational organisation provides plenty of value to society in the form of a more productive and competant workforce but getting the workforce to pay for its own education is not ideal. It's the businesses that employ the educated individuals that benefit most, so it would make sense to try and source a school's revenue from there rather than the individual being educated. Particularly since an uneducated individual isn't likely to have much money to pay for the education to begin with.</li>
	<li>Again it is the companies that benefit from the results of research but getting the government to pay for university research grants is what happens instead.</li>
	<li>And of course my personal favourite complaint: an open source developer that creates a valuable open source library or framework hardly captures any value at all. Open source development is occasionally more efficient, usually when developing a tool that is used by many people but the value can only be captured by the people who use it. If the developer of an open source tool doesn't use the tool themself there aren't currently business models that allow them to capture that value.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't had much time to think on the topic so there may be other market smells I haven't yet noticed but I'll likely write about it when I do. It seems like a useful concept.</p>
