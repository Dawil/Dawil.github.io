						Market Smell: Charities and Good Will
					</a>
				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 I think that business models relying on good will or charity are a market smell and  where possible should be replaced with better business models. As economics or entrepreneurs we should not be content with a charity to solve a problem until we can honestly say we&#39;ve exhausted every other possibility (or admit we are making a compromise in the name of pragmatism).

					</a>
				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 Arms races in markets are a market smell. They&#39;re inefficient duplication of investments that at best don&#39;t get spent. This is true from military to DRM to anti-bot detection.

				<p class="abstract">
 A known solution to a game of chicken is pre-commitment, making a show of not backing out before the game starts. If we applied this incrementally to matching donations we could maybe solve the chicken problem for raising funds.

 In reading
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">
  Antifragile
 </a>
 it&#39;s seemed that the concept relates to software and programming in many ways, including language design, testing, bug bounties and project management.

						A Book I'd Like to Read: Evolution Wars

				<p class="abstract">
 I was reading about
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber-toothed_cat#Biology">
  Saber-toothed cats
 </a>
 , as you do, and was interested in how saber tooths were a case of convergent evolution, and one cat would typically fill the hole left by a previously extinct saber tooth predecessor. It makes growing saber teeth seem like a strategy, which in a co-evolution context has positive and negative trade offs. The sequence of strategies employed by species against each other sound like they&#39;d make an interesting book. So I&#39;d like to describe in a little more detail what I&#39;d like in the book.

 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">
  Pareto Efficiency
 </a>
 is a notion that&#39;s helpful in discriminating between different allocations of resources. Political discussions are typically about moral stances and resource allocations, many of which are trade offs, e.g. coal miner jobs versus climate change. As such, terminology from the notion of Pareto Efficiency are well suited for discussing and reasoning about political dilemmas..

						Review to View

				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 Aggregator sites like reddit and hackernews are a valuable feature of the internet. They provide a single location for a reader to find all sorts of news articles on the web. One thing they do poorly, however, is provide a valuable signal to noise ratio. In this article I propose a crowd sourced technique for improving that which I call Review to View.

						Publicly Traded Employees
					</a>
				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 Publicly trading companies allows the market better invest in them. This allows a company to more readily raise investments and creates price signals regarding the relative worth of companies. What if we could do the same for employees? Should we do the same employees? I think it could potentially help fund education and is worth consideration.

				<p class="abstract">
 Gaining a critical mass of users for a web-app is incredibly difficult. Many good web-apps likely die as infants before they&#39;ve truely had the chance to demonstrate their worth. I propose commodotising test users to make reaching that critical mass less ruled by chance.
