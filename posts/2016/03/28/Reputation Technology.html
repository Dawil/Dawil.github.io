		<p class="abstract">The Reputation Economy, more commonly referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy">Sharing Economy</a>, is thought to be a next big thing but little thought is put into the technology required to make it work. In this post I argue that more focus needs to be given to Reputation Technologies in order for Reputation Economies to develop.</p>

<h3>Uber for Babysitters</h3>

<p>An Uber for Babysitters is a great idea. Sure you'd rather have the same babysitter all the time so your child can get comfortable with them. But what if something unexpected comes up and your usual babysitter is busy? Being able to call in a new babysitter as quickly as you can call in a car would be liberating for parents. So why is no one doing it?</p>

<p>Obviously it's because you can only leave someone you trust in charge of your child. The degree of trust needed to get into an Uber ride is substantially lower than the degree of trust needed to leave your child for a period of time. So that's it then, Uber for Baby Sitters will never work?</p>

<p>Well no. Remember Uber couldn't have worked until recently. Uber needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a supply of car owner/drivers with unutilised time</li>
	<li>a group of people in demand for transport</li>
	<li>members of both groups having smartphones enabling the easy facilitation of the transaction</li>
</ul>

<p>This much is obvious. But perhaps the most overlooked thing needed was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(classification)">5-star rating system</a>. It's so basic you might take it for granted but without such crude reputation technology you'd never have the requisite trust for Uber to exist. It's entirely possible that with improved Reputation Technology an Uber for Babysitters would become feasible.</p>

<h3>5-Star Ratings & Baby Sitting</h3>

<p>So what does baby sitting require that a Uber's 5-star system lacks? Probably many things but I'll focus on just one thing: subjectivity.</p>

<p>An Uber driver's suitability for the job is roughly the same for all passengers. They need to be able to follow directions from their GPS and they need to not have malicious motives, that's about it. A babysitter however needs to be good for the particular child or children they're baby sitting. The following are some of the subjective qualities a babysitter would need:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the number of children they work best with</li>
	<li>the age of the children</li>
	<li>the energy levels of the children</li>
	<li>the language and culture of the children</li>
	<li>and you get the point</li>
</ul>

<p>It's easy to conceive of a babysitter that's great with children aged 4 with high energy levels speaking English, but terrible with children aged 8 who are calmer and more shy and speaking Chinese. At this point it's not a matter of the quality of the babysitter but of their suitability. And a single 5-star rating system is inadequate for distinguishing who is the most suitable for your child.</p>

<h3>What next?</h3>

<p>Baby sitting isn't something I'm particularly interested in, it's just an easy contrast to Uber. However an Uber for Babysitting would interest me because it would mean our Reputation Technology was advanced enough for a great deal more things. We could:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Easily match-make teams for group activities. Organizing a soccer match amongst friends is horrendously difficult, but joining a club comes with a degree of commitment you may not be prepared for. Imagine if you could find 20 friendly people you could play soccer with as quickly as you can find 10 people to play in an online multiplayer video game like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive">CS:GO</a>.</li>
	<li>Augment resumes, which are currently accepted as terrible, with far more trustworthy information.</li>
	<li>Better distinguish companies and their impact in our economy. Large corporations will always find loop holes in tax law but if customers can make informed decisions about where to shop based on how much tax that company pays we could close tax avoidance from the consumer side.</li>
	<li>Better measure success of welfare programs. Most unemployment benefits come under the condition that the unemployed person show evidence they've been applying for jobs. This is a weak form of Reputation Technology trying to prove the applicant isn't trying to leech of the system. This has further implications in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">UBI</a> discussion. What if you could realistically give a basic income to only people with a "hard working" reputation? Suddenly a lot of the arguments against this type of welfare fall apart.</li>
</ul>

<p>My imagination has its limits but I hope this makes it obvious that the breadth of impact of advanced Reputation Technology is massive. But it is imperative that the technology be advanced before attempting to create the applications. If you tried to make an Uber for Babysitters today you'd just be making another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PalmPilot">Palm Pilot</a>: something before its time.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer: Failures like Peeple</h3>

<p>As Ben's comment below states, Reputation Technology can cause harm just as easily as it can create value.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeple_(mobile_application)">Peeple</a>, initially described as "Yelp for people" drew massive fire immediately upon launch because of the asymmetric reputation warfare it would likely enable. Although it would be nice if your hard won rep in one aspect of life could carry over into another aspect of life, allowing just anyone to have a say in what your reputation ought to be has disastrous potential.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb for analyzing a piece of reputation technology, "how does it compare to a small village where everyone is known?". In a small village anyone can gossip negatively about you, similar to on Peeple, but in a small village the reputation of the gossiper is also taken into account when considering what impact the gossip should have on your reputation.</p>
