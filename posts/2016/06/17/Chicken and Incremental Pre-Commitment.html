		<h1> Chicken and Incremental Pre-Commitment </h1>
		<p class=abstract>A known solution to a game of chicken is pre-commitment, making a show of not backing out before the game starts. If we applied this incrementally to matching donations we could maybe solve the chicken problem for raising funds.</p>

<p>If wikipedia needs $1 dollar to keep their servers running and you and I use it, we could split the cost 50% each and keep the lights on over at Wikipedia. Alternatively I could fold my arms and play chicken with you, waiting until you forked out the whole $1. If you or I misjudge each other wikipedia goes down, but if I'm right I don't have to part with my precious dollar.</p>

<p>But if you pre-commit 75 cents on the condition I provide 25 cents you've lessened the burden on me. At some ratio, possibly 75:25, the risk of wikipedia going down is greater than the cost to nullify that risk. So what if you scaled it up the real world, with millions of wikipedia users?</p>

<p>I pledge $10 to be conditionally given to wikipedia <em>only</em> if someone else gives out $1. Then let's say someone else adds to that, making it $20 but only if $3 is paid. We've tripled the amount someone may have to offer but doubled the amount unlocked. Or we could go the other way, and make it $2 to unlock $30. The point is we can choose to add to both sides, the conditional donation or the matching donation.</p>

<p>One thing we'd expect though is for a conditional to matching ratio of greater than 1 is more likely to succeed than one less than 1.</p>

<p>What else can we do? We can even put a conditional donation to matching donation. Say there is $300 on offer for a matching $100, I can offer $10 to the $100 on the condition someone else adds $5 to the $100 sum. This means we can increase the ratio of conditional to matching without any indiviudal having to offer a conditional to matching ratio less than 1.</p>

<p>So what's the point of all this? Well, with no individual matching on a ratio less than 1 we can build up a massive conditional to matching ratio. We can have thousands of individuals play chicken against just the one person, encouraging them to donate just a small sum of money to unlock a massive sum of money. This may solve the chicken raised in the previous post.</p>
