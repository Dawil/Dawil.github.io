		<h1> Information should be free but Authors should be paid </h1>
		<p class=abstract>In this post we start with the two assertions in the title and follow the consequences to see how information should be priced.</p>

<p><em>In all the decades we've had the internet, we've never yet had an internet that prioritized high quality information over "interesting" information.</em></p>

<p>So we have two assertions we'd like to make:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Information should be free. This should be a hallmark of a digital age, information is free to replicate so it should be free to download. Essentially it should be a public good. This is also due to the Network Effect, whereby the information itself becomes more valuable the more people know it.</li>
	<li>Authors and content creators ought to be paid. This reward mechanism is Capitalism 101 and allows good content creators to create better content and encourages others with the skills to themselves become content creators.</li>
</ol>

<p>However these two assertions are at first glance at odds with each other. If I shouldn't have to pay GRRM to download Game of Thrones how can we expect the next season to be made? It's an incredibly expensive TV series to create. Thus we need to find a way for content creators to be paid for their work.</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>This is the weakest part of the blog post. I'm going to say that what's most valuable in a digital age isn't the information, but the connection of <em>pertinent</em> information to the viewer/reader/consumer. You could give all of Wikipedia on hard drives to a poor person but they're not going to pull themselves out of poverty unless they know <em>which</em> articles to read. The Signal to Noise ratio that a consumer receives is what's important.</p>

<p>So maybe if we can find a way for consumers to pay for recommendations, we can find a way to get the recommenders to pay the authors. Let's examine recommendations. There are two kinds of recommendations:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Pull based (known unknown): a consumer goes looking, maybe through google, for the answer to their question</li>
	<li>Push based (unknown unknown): a recommendor approaches a consumer offering them the advice of some information they would be interested in</li>
</ol>

<p>In the pull based recommendation you could be a doctor and a patient comes to you with symptoms for you to diagnose. In push based you might be a netflix "people who watched this also watched this" algorithm.

<p>For now let's assume we have a natural way to turn a profit on both kinds of recommendations and instead see if there is a way for recommendors to pay the authors.</p>

<h3>The Free Rider Problem</h3>

<p>Assuming you were the only recommender in the whole market it would be simple. Just pass on some of your profits to the authors in proportion to the amount of profit they each earn you. If you're constantly recommending harry potter to people then send cash J.K. Rowling's way. However as soon as another recommender enters the market, they're now tempted to Free Ride. That is continue recommending to people, but leave the paying authors part to you. As the number of recommenders increases the incentive to free ride increases and the amount authors get paid decreases. So how can we address this?</p>

<p>We could weaken the first assertion, that information should be free, but then we'd enter an arms race as recommendors tried to pirate information.</p>

<p>We could form some sort of union of recommendors that paid authors for their work but then we'd need to police people to make sure they joined the union of recommendors and paid their fees. This starts another arms race as illegal recommendors try to smugle recommendations.</p>

<p>Authors could refuse to create their content until it had been paid for upfront, until a threshold pledge has been met. This works to an extent but problems still exist. Let's examine them.</p>

<h4>Threshold Pledge</h4>

<p>In order for enough money to be raised by recommendors pooling their resources there has to be trust that the author's content will be valuable. If you're an author promising to write a text book on a new subject then people know roughly what they'll get, but if you're an author offering a new sci-fi series then it's very hard for recommendors to trust it'll be worth anything. Well established authors may have enough trust, but new authors won't be able to raise much in advance.</p>

<p>We also still have a weaker free rider problem, a game of chicken. If I know that another recommendor needs this content more than I do, I'll just wait for them to pledge to reach the threshold. Money will be raised, so this is an improvement, but it will be unfairly raised from only those who value it most. It would be better if those who valued it a little at least paid a little.</p>

<p>The other problem is that because the money is raised up front there's no long tail to author, otherwise known as royalties. If the content is an unexpected viral hit it's the recommendors who will benefit not the author. The author will have increased credibility when raising funds for future work but telling them that may not make them as happy as paying them would have.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>So by assuming there exists business models for recommendors, we've reduced the problem of free information but paid authors to solving the game of chicken and the long tail problem, by using threshold pledges to fund content. I'm going to end this blog post here but I think I have an idea on how to solve these problems.</p>
