		<h1> Royalties Unions </h1>
		<p>If an author used a threshold pledge to raise funds for their work but then the work become unexpectedly successful how should the author be rewarded for that? Their reputation is increased so they can raise more funds for future works, but that's small comfort if this is the only successful work they create.</p>

<p>They could cash in on that reputation and say they refuse to create more content until they've received adequate royalties for their first work. However their bargaining power is weak. Other authors provide competing content and there's no guarrantee their next work will be as good as their first, if they'll produce any more content at all. One thing they can do to increase their bargaining power is to join a Royalties Union with other authors.</p>

<p>In a royalties union, if author Alex feels inadequately rewarded for the success of their work, the rest of the union can go on strike and vow not to produce any more content until Alex is satisfied. Authors with fame and reputation are encouraged to join a union to make sure their get their royalties, and authors intending to build fame and reputation are encouraged to join as insurance incase their work becomes successful.</p>

<p>In this way we can encourage consumers to pay royalties to an author voluntarily.</p>
