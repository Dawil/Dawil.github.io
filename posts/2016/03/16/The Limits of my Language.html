		<h1>The Limits of my Language</h1>
		<p>This post is an introduction to my blog, covering my motivations for blogging and what sort of topics can be expected.</p>

<h3>Why Blog?</h3>

<p>I used to be averse to the idea of having a "favourite quote". Most such quotes I'd encountered had been witty truisms or even worse: opinions. However at some point I encountered a quote which changed my mind:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein">
The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
</blockquote>

<p>from the philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>. It succinctly put into words a thought that had been forming in my mind about programming language features. The idea was that if your language lacks a language feature, say anonymous functions, you'll stop using anonymous functions when thinking of solutions. By using a language that can express a thought you are enabling that thought to exist.</p>

<p>Why I consider the quote a favourite is somewhat recursive. It encourages you to put to words and name things, but putting to words the thought of doing just that. However once you do that, it becomes more apparent how broadly applicable the idea is.</p>

<h3>Hygge</h3>

<p>As an example, there's when I encountered the Danish word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Denmark#Hygge">Hygge</a>. It named a concept I'd thought of before, or rather it named a thing I felt had been lacking or insufficient in my life at the time. Once it had been named I was now free to reason about it. It was as if a doctor had finally diagnosed a mysterious illness. Rectifying the situation was now possible.</p>

<p>So I've decided to blog my thoughts for two reasons. The first is so that others can inform me of names for them, the second is so that others can learn names from me.</p>

<h3>Blog about what?</h3>

<p>I'm a paid software developer with interests in behavioural economics, entrepreneurship, open source concepts and programming. So for now expect posts about those topics.</p>
