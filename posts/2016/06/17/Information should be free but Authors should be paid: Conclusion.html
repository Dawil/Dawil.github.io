		<h1> Information should be free but Authors should be paid: Conclusion </h1>
		<p>We've established authors should raise funds for their work using threshold pledges. These pledges should use matching donations or incremental pre-commitment in order to solve the chicken problem, and that authors should join royalties unions so they can get rewarded in retrospect for unexpectedly successful works. Let's just run through what this looks like as an author and as a consumer.</p>

<h3>As an author</h3>

<p>I have an idea for a book I want to write. I'm not very famous so when I ask for a threshold pledge I don't ask for much. This is to be expected, every business must prove itself before raising large funds.</p>

<p>I raise the funds, however small, and deliver the book. It is free, as agreed by the threshold pledge. It is either successful or unsuccessful. If it's unsuccessful and I'm a bad author I'll likely struggle to raise more funds for my next book and can't expect any royalties. If it is successful I'll join a royalties club and ask for more money for my next threshold pledge.</p>

<p>If I or another author in my royalties club is unfairly treated with respect to their royalties we all go on strike until they are rewarded. The strike is either succesfull and justice as we see it is restored, or the strike breaks and that author must accept they won't see any more royalties.</p>

<h3>As a consumer</h3>

<p>I see an interesting book being suggested for a threshold pledge. I put down either a conditional or a matching pledge. If the threshold isn't reach I get my money back. If it is the author works on the book.</p>

<p>The book is delivered and it's free. I enjoy it or I don't. If I don't that's the end of that. If I do I now follow that author and consider donating to any later threshold pledges they offer. If the author goes on strike I consider paying them out of the strike.</p>

<h3>Is this better?</h3>

<p>I like the idea, do you?</p>
