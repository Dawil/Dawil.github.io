			Mechanical Turk for Web-Apps
		</h1>
		<p class="abstract">Gaining a critical mass of users for a web-app is incredibly difficult. Many good web-apps likely die as infants before they've truely had the chance to demonstrate their worth. I propose commodotising test users to make reaching that critical mass less ruled by chance.</p>

<p>For now let's call it ShillsAreUs.com (name not final).</p>

<h3>What's it look like?</h3>

<p>A form. Enter:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your web app</li>
	<li>A description of the activity you want the users to do</li>
	<li>A duration for which you want the users to be active</li>
	<li>A quantity of users</li>
	<li>A timezone for the users to operate in</li>
	<li>Any other key demographs you'd want the users to belong to</li>
	<li>A method for linking ShillsAreUs users to your signed up users so you can tag them in you Google Analytics and verify they're doing what you asked. Would likely also require you include a script from ShillsAreUs that also reports limited user activity back to them so they can audit behavior and verify users are earning their pay</li>
</ul>

<p>You would then receive traffic from ShillsAreUs as requested.</p>

<h3>Isn't this shady?</h3>

<p>The intent isn't to trick other users into thinking the site is active, or to shill for you (hence why the name isn't final). The intent is to provide test users who will hopefully continue to use the website after the paid period because it provides real value to them.</p>

<h3>Isn't this what ads are for?</h3>

<p>Ads don't pay people to visit a site for a set time period.</p>

<h3>This blog post seems rather terse</h3>

<p>This is the 4th post I've written tonight. I wanted to get these ideas out of my head but I want to go to bed...</p>
