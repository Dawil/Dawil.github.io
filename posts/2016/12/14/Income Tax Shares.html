		<h1> Income Tax Shares </h1>
		<p class=abstract>Yet another crazy economics idea of mine: selling shares in income tax revenue to align business interests with communities and encourage investment. Crazy or genius, you decide!</p>

<h3>Shares align Interests</h3>

<p>At least in theory, dividending shares align the interests of the shareholder with the company that produces the dividends. If the company does well your dividends go up. This can be good encouragement to employees, making them want to work harder because it's in their own interests.</p>

<h3>There are towns and communities that could do with investment</h3>

<p>In this age of Urbanisation cities are doing fine. They get plenty of investment into infrastructure, at least relative to the towns from which their inhabitants are immigrating from. These towns may have decreasing populations, serious brain drains, and dwindling tax revenue to spend on growth producing investments. If business were to pick up in these towns, then tax revenue would pick up, and local governments could then invest it. But this produces a chicken-egg problem, business won't pick up until the investments are made, the investments wont be made until business picks up, so nothing gets done.</p>

<h3>Income Tax Shares</h3>

<p>The idea behind Income Tax Shares is to provide another way for business to capture value from their investments. Let's say a business builds a shopping centre in a town. They get the revenue from the customers coming to the shopping centre, great. But the centre creates jobs, which enables spending in on other goods and services in the town, possibly creating more jobs or at least improving income, and thus tax.</p>

<p>That's a positive externality. We're familiar with negative externalities, for example when a company isn't charged for the pollution to the environment they cause, but a positive externality is when a company isn't getting as much of the profit from the value they are creating. To me this is a Market Smell, a sign that inefficiencies are taking place.</p>

<p>Consider a business contemplating building a shopping centre, but deciding they won't be able to recapture enough of their investment for it to be worth it. However this means the town is missing out on the positive externalities of increase business for everyone, and the local government from increased income tax. This is where Income Tax Shares save the day.</p>

<p>The would be investor buys Income Tax Shares in the town. An example might be he purchases the right to 5% of income tax revenue from the town for the next 3-5 years. The price would be what the local government thinks it will be based on previous years. If the investor then creates value, causing income tax revenue to increase passed what the local government expected, he'll then get to capture some of that extra revenue. This could be the difference between deciding to build the shopping centre and not.</p>

<h3>Other applications</h3>

<p>This isn't the only scenario in which Income Tax Shares might be handy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In the same way as employees might like to own shares in their company, local businesses might want to own shares in their local economy. This would incentivise them to pay their employees more and cooperate with other businesses.</li>
	<li>Income Tax Shares need not be segmented geographically. They could instead be segmented demographically. If there is a disenfranchised indigenous population in the country, selling Income Tax Shares for that demograph would encourage businesses to increase the income of that demograph, maybe by employing them or providing them more competitive training.</li>
	<li>Income Tax Shares would provide price signalling for Tax Revenue. An open market for them would result in a lot of ananlysis put into predicting income tax by all segments available, aiding political discussion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I'll be the first to admit I have some crazy ideas, but this was a fun one, and I'd like to hear other people's thoughts on it.</p>
