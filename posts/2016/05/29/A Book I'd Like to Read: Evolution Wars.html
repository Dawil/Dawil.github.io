		<h1> A Book I'd Like to Read: Evolution Wars </h1>
		<p class=abstract>I was reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber-toothed_cat#Biology">Saber-toothed cats</a>, as you do, and was interested in how saber tooths were a case of convergent evolution, and one cat would typically fill the hole left by a previously extinct saber tooth predecessor. It makes growing saber teeth seem like a strategy, which in a co-evolution context has positive and negative trade offs. The sequence of strategies employed by species against each other sound like they'd make an interesting book. So I'd like to describe in a little more detail what I'd like in the book.</p>

<p>This post is a bit of a ramble so first of all, if this book already exists then someone please tell me, beacause I'd love to read it. We could also then skip the rest of this post.</p>

<p>The purpose of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel was nicely summed up by framing it in the context of a question "Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?". This central question helped make the rest of the book cohesive so maybeI should come up with a question for this book. Something like, "What do we know of the history of the co-evolution of species, told as if the different species were factions at war?". Unfortenately I'm dissatisfied with the question so I'll spend the rest of this post clarifying what I mean.</p>

<p>The wiki page linked above started this thought, so I'll inline a quote from it:</p>

<blockquote>
	it seems that the shift to obligate carnivorism, along with co-evolution with large prey animals, led the saber-toothed cats of each time period to extinction. As per Van Valkenburgh, the adaptations that made saber-toothed cats successful also made the creatures vulnerable to extinction. In her example, trends toward an increase in size, along with greater specialization, acted as a "macro-evolutionary ratchet": when large prey became scarce or extinct, these creatures would be unable to adapt to smaller prey or consume other sources of food, and would be unable to reduce their size so as to need less food.
</blockquote>

<p>Reading between the lines, this is saying that the saber tooth gave cats an advantage against larger prey. This lead them to increase in size and become dependent on larger prey, which are themselves more vulnerable to extinction. This play-by-play is what I'm interested in. Did this lead to the preyed upon species to shrink? Are there common patterns between predators besides longer canine teeth? What were the tradeoffs of these strategies? Are there other cases where poor evolution strategies lead to extinction?</p>

<p>Of course I'm aware that evolution is blind, but it's clear that species react to each other, not just the environment. In Guns, Germs and Steel, it's said that part of why there's so many mega fauna in Africa is because species there co-evolved with humans, unlike elsewhere where evolved humans had too much success and brought mega fauna to extinction. But I'd like to hear more of the co-evolution in Africa. What came before zebra, and what did they change to become safe against humans?.</p>

<p>For an added bonus, I'd like to see the book written with an awareness of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_concept">Solution concepts</a> from game theory, if that at all makes sense.</p>
