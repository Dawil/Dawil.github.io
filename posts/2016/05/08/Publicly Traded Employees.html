		<h1> Publicly Traded Employees </h1>
		<p class="abstract">Publicly trading companies allows the market better invest in them. This allows a company to more readily raise investments and creates price signals regarding the relative worth of companies. What if we could do the same for employees? Should we do the same employees? I think it could potentially help fund education and is worth consideration.</p>

<p>I'll admit this is an odd idea, even for me. At first glance it's horrific, you could almost call this slavery, right? So even if this could open up a new source of revenue for funding education it's important to treat this subject serious consideration to make sure unintended consequences don't produce a monster.</p>

<h3>What does owning an employee mean?</h3>

<p>Owning a company through shares has various meanings. For the share to have real value it must translate to some real aspect of the company. Commonly it means owning a right to decision making, owning a fraction of the company profits, or some combination of both. A first guess at what employee shares would grant might include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>decisions over where the employee works</li>
	<li>a share of the employee's income</li>
</ul>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlPQkd_AA6chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlPQkd_AA6c">as much as some would like to differ</a>, people are not corporations. So I think the first item, deciding where an employee works, isn't a good thing to trade on a public (or private) market. So where does that leave us?</p>

<h3>What's in it for the employee?</h3>

<p>Obviously owning a share of what an employee earns sounds great to the shareholder, but why would any sane person agree to that? It's commonly accepted that <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-should-you-stay-in-a-job-for">job-hopping is the new norm</a>. Even if a company is willing to keep you for decades on end instead of replace you with a cheaper junior, you may not want to stay there for decades when you may be able to improve your pay and experience by moving on. Not to mention the excitement of a new job.</p>

<p>This new norm destroys a useful feature of long term employment: value capture. When a company can trust that you'll still be working for them in 10 years, they'll do everything they can in the first few years to improve your qualifications so you can be as valuable to them as possible as soon as possible. If you're likely to leave after 4 years, it no longer seems worth the investment. What's worse is you may go to work for a competitor, so any investment in you could actually work against them.</p>

<p>If instead a company owns, say 25% of your income, then an investment in you can continue to pay off even after you've left the company. I think this enables a powerful new dynamic. A company that makes a habit of hiring juniors can now afford to invest in more training for their employees before they go graduate to a more skilled company. Instead of this being a loss the first company has the choice the sell the shares now if they think the former employee has peaked, or hang on if they think the employee has a successful career ahead of them.</p>

<h3>Extended Consequences</h3>

<p>But the consequences extend beyond the company and its employees. The two most significant other areas I can think of are market level investors and education.</p>

<h4>Market Investors</h4>

<p>Let's say there now existed a market for publicly traded employees. Shares for an employee included information like that employee's:</p>

<ul>
	<li>job history</li>
	<li>education history</li>
	<li>additional free-form references from employees</li>
	<li>publicly stated intentions from employee themself</li>
</ul>

<p>You could now invest in the job market in various interesting ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>invest in all employees in a job position, e.g. accountants</li>
	<li>invest in all employees from specific educational institutions</li>
	<li>go short on an industry you think may not have a good future, e.g. transport if you've been reading about self-driving cars</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that investing in job positions is different to investing in industries, as some jobs are common between industries.</p>

<h4>Edication</h4>

<p>The impact on education would be two-fold.</p>

<p>Firstly the price signals generated by a successful educator would provide a much needed feedback regarding the quality of a teacher. If students of a particular teacher typically see a greater increase in market price than alternative teachers then prostective students will take that information into consideration.</p>

<p>Secondly it gives students another way to pay for their education. In contrast to a loan, paying for education with shares takes a percentage of income, not a flat loan with an interest rate. That doesn't necessarily make it better, but it does increase the choices that the student/employee has.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>Unsurprisingly there are some problems with this idea, least of all that it's not yet well thought out.</p>

<h4>Bankruptcy</h4>

<p>What happens if a person sells 100% of their income shares? Does that mean they get 0% of their paycheck? Then they would have no reason to work. For this reason I think it makes sense to limit the amount of a person's income that is publicly traded, e.g. 100% of a person's income shares equates to at most 50% of their income.</p>

<h4>Cash payments</h4>

<p>Wouldn't this encourage a person to accept cash payments so they can keep as large a portion of their income as possible? Thankfully this problem isn't too difficult to solve. If a person's shared income is small, their shares won't be worth much and no one would want to trade them. Secondly an employee has the option of paying out dividends to their shareholders. If an employee has a history of paying out dividends then that will be priced in to their shares. This gives people who wish to keep their share price high a way to do that even if most of their income is through cash.</p>

<h4>Retirement</h4>

<p>This one is tricky. As a person ages the likelyhood they're going to retire increases. What good are shares in an income that stops next year? You could attempt to force employees to announce their retirement in advance but not all retirements are voluntary. What if an employee gets ill and is no longer fit for employement? It seems like older employees are almost guarranteed to have poorer share prices despite greater experience due to the volatility in their future income.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I think this is an interesting idea worth further investigation. Giving companies a way to invest in their employees after they've left is in itself a good enough reason to examine this topic. A high school education is becomming increasingly less useful for high skilled jobs, as is the idea that education is a thing you grow out of. Finding a natural way to mix education into employement would be a great outcome.</p>
