		<h1> Market Smell: Arms Races </h1>
		<p class=abstract>Arms races in markets are a market smell. They're inefficient duplication of investments that at best don't get spent. This is true from military to DRM to anti-bot detection.</p>

<p>If your business model relies on winning an arms race, e.g. Facebook needs to ensure all of their users are real, not bots, and that all of the clicks on their ads are by interested users, not click farms, then you're already at a loss. Likewise if you rely on DRM to verify that a viewer of your content paid for it. Not only are you spending money on something that harms the user experience instead of something that improves it but most online tech arms races are asymmetric in nature. Facebook may invest hundreds of programmer hours into combating bots created from only tens of of programmer hours.</p>

<p>So what's the solution? You should try to find an incentive compatible business model where there isn't profit to be made in an arms race. For facebook that would mean finding a model that captures value from the value they've created for their users, instead of from ads. For example if we were to say that Facebook's value is in facilitating events like BBQs or music festivals, then their business model should focus on providing good venues to host those events at and good food at these events. Or if you said their value was in providing business connections then they should try to focus their business model on employment commissions.</p>

<p>For DRM business that provide content to users, they should instead focus on the recommendation of good content or the convenience of viewing the content on any device. Thus netflix does a far better job than its competitors, but still not a completely incentive compatible one. It may still be more convenient to view a Netflix show on my computer in my video player with my subtitles when offline, something which Netflix doesn't allow and is always going to lose an arms race to prevent.</p>
