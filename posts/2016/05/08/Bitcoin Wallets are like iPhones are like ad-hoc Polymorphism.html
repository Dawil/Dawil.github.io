		<h1> Bitcoin Wallets are like iPhones are like ad-hoc Polymorphism </h1>
		<p class="abstract">What do iPhones, Bitcoin Wallets, and Java interfaces have in common? They all enrich their networks with super powers. Or atleast, bitcoins might eventually.</p>

<h3>iPhones give you Super Powers</h3>

<p>You have only to watch a TV show from before 2000 where characters get lost or are unable to communicate with each other to realise just how significant smart phones are. But how do we describe this significance?</p>

<p>In an Object-oriented language you can add ad-hoc polymorphism to objects by making them implement an interface. In Haskell you instead have typeclasses and in Rust you have traits, however the effect is similar. If you make classes Cat, Dog and Human all implement the interface Move, you can take a collection of them and tell them to all move somewhere. Yay...</p>

<p>But now add some more interfaces, Speak, Eat, Poop, and the list of things you can do with that collection of cats, dogs and humans doesn't increase linearly; it increases factorially. What's so great about iPhones is that it increases the set of possible interfaces a Human Being can implement. A human with a smart phone can call people, look at maps, look up articles, translate text, and more. A human without a smart phone can't.</p>

<h3>Bitcoin Wallets will give you Super Powers</h3>

<p>The same is true for Bitcoin Wallets. I'm not a bitcoin nutter (although I recognise that may be a relative term), I'm the sort of person who primarily sees bitcoin as a distributed payment protocol. But that alone is significant. It greatly lowers the friction for payment and, coupled with a device like an iPhone, opens the door on a great many new interactions between humans. However I think it's still missing something.</p>

<h3>Bitcoin Wallets are like Smart Phones pre 2007</h3>

<p>It's my suspician that the network isn't ready yet for bitcoin wallets, just like manufactoring wasn't ready yet for smartphones when the Palm Pilot was around. I can't claim to know all of what the network is missing but I suspect widespread usage of Client Certificates is one of them, a topic which I'll be discussing in a later post.</p>
