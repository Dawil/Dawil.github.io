		<h1> Belief Trap </h1>
		<p class=abstract>Say you believe that God exists, and he's testing your faith. If you find some dinosaur bones that suggest the universe existed before 6000 years ago do you no longer believe in God, or does this confirm the belief that God is testing you? In this post I will discuss Belief Traps, internally consitent views of the world from which you can't logically escape.</p>

<p>What's problematic about the above example is there isn't a rational way to escape that belief. Any evidence in opposition to your held beliefs is just confirmation of the belief itself. But outside of contrived religious examples, does this matter? Well I'd say, increasingly so.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>In the 2016 US election race the narrative was pushed by Trump that the media was rigged against him. When the media argue against that narrative it in turn becomes proof that they're biased against him. Once someone holds the belief that the media is aligned against Trump it becomes very difficult to shake that belief.</p>

<p>And it's not only Republicans. It's now being said by many that the Russians rigged the election in favour of Trump. Any evidence proposed against this by Trump and family is just proof that they have something to hide.</p>

<p>Or Pizzagate, the belief that there is a massive coverup of Establishment figures engaging in child sex rings. If you believe it could be true, and someone dismisses the possibility, that person now becomes suspect of being complicit. That's exactly what a secret pedophile would do!</p>

<p>Or a slightly more nuanced one, that Trump voters are racist. Obvious disclaimers about notalltrumpsupporters aside, a Trump supporter may try to describe why their beliefs are not racist. However because they are a Trump supporter, and Trump supporters are racist, you needn't pay as much attention to their arguments and can be dissmissive of it. Racists always say that they're not racist!</p>

<h3>How to escape a Belief Trap</h3>

<p>Cognitive dissonance is given a bad wrap. You accuse people of being a hypocrite while being a hypocrite yourself! That's coginitive dissonance! Well yes, and that's unfortunate, but the ability to have cognitive dissonance is important and a requirement for escaping a belief trap.</p>

<p>If you can entertain the possibility of two conflicting beliefs in your head at once you can consider both beliefs together. Either God is trying to test me, and all evidence of his non-existence is a test, or God isn't trying to test me, and evidence of his non-existence might be worth considering. Escape from the belief trap becomes possible when we consider things that we disagree with.</p>

<h3>What should you do?</h3>

<p>You should start actively seeking beliefs that you disagree with and seriously contemplating them. I can think something, without believing it. Take something you fundamentally believe to be false, and consider if it could be true. Is the earth actually flat? Have you actually seen the curve? People say you can calculate the curvature based on shadows, but have you actually done that, personally measure the shadows?</p>

<p>Either you're going to come out of your inquisition with a more well-founded belief than you went in, or you're going to change your mind because you've been convinced by new information. Both outcomes are good.</p>
