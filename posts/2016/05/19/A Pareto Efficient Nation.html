		<h1> A Pareto Efficient Nation </h1>
		<p class=abstract><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto Efficiency</a> is a notion that's helpful in discriminating between different allocations of resources. Political discussions are typically about moral stances and resource allocations, many of which are trade offs, e.g. coal miner jobs versus climate change. As such, terminology from the notion of Pareto Efficiency are well suited for discussing and reasoning about political dilemmas..</p>

<p>The wiki page linked does a good enough job of describing pareto efficiency so I wont repeat it here. A short summary would be, if there are multiple goods or outcomes that depend on shared resources a Pareto Efficient allocation of resources is one that can't increase the amount of one type of good produced without reducing the amount of another good produced.</p>

<h3>Coal Miner Jobs vs Climate Change</h3>

<p>Since this came up recently in the American Election race we'll use it as an example. In short, Hilary was in favor of cutting coal miner jobs because they contribute to climate change, while Trump has no doubt taken the alternative position of protecting those jobs. In resource allocation terms, we're discussing if we want coal miners (human resources) to be allocated to coal mining jobs.</p>

<p>Political discourse has never really tolerated nuance but even so it's disappointing to only see these two positions being discussed. Both positions are able to diagnose the flaws with the other: unchecked climate change or rampant job loss. However to say that no compromise ought to be made is to imply that we are on the Pareto Efficient Frontier and one party must be worse off for the other to benefit. That's a bold claim: not doing anything about climate change is obviously inefficient by any metric that considers the future, and axing thousands of jobs is also going to cause turmoil for the families involved and the communities that depend on them. Thus the default reaction should be to look for a Pareto Improvement.</p>

<h3>Pareto Improvement</h3>

<p>If we're not a nation that has allocated all of its resources efficiently then there ought to exist a different allocation of resources that makes everyone better off. In this scenario what might that look like?</p>
<p>A simplified example solution, for illustrative purposes only, might look like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>giving tax cuts to coal miners who change jobs out of the industry,</li>
	<li>increased tax to any new coal miners two years from now,</li>
	<li>some form of coal tax, such as an emissions trading scheme,</li>
	<li>offering carbon credits for the reduction in emissions from one year to the next</li>
</ul>

<p>The main focus of the above example is to put pressure on the coal industry, both the workers and the owners, but to also make sure there's room for them to move. Giving the workers an incentive to look for alternative labor helps reduce economic collateral caused by unplanned job loss. Likewise giving value back to the owners proportional to the emissions they reduce helps keep loss in net worth inflicted by policy change to a minimum while incentivising a business model pivot. All parties have the opportunity to profit from this policy change, rather than the zero sum game that is currently being offered.</p>

<p>This may not be a perfect solution, but you can see how with a little bit of thought you can both decrease the impact on climate change while also decrease the size of the vacuum you would have created in the economy if all those jobs and assets had to be struck off. So long as a nation is not at the Pareto Efficient Frontier, a solution to a resource allocation problem can likely be achieved that leaves everyone better off.</p>

<p>A politician that offers a zero sum solution isn't trying hard enough.</p>
