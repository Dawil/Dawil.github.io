		<h1> Donating is a Game for Pessimistic Chickens and How to Fix that </h1>
		<p>Let's say that Wikipedia needs $100 from you or they'll have to stop the servers, close their data centres, and call it quits. Would you pay? You most likely would, $100 for Wikipedia is a good deal. Let's say instead Wikipedia needs $100 total from you and Bob. Would you still pay? You might. You might wait and see if Bob pays. You might not pay, even if you would have paid when it was only you who could provide the $100. In this way charity is like a game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)">Chicken</a>.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar, Chicken is when two cars drive at each other, and the first driver to swerve out of the way to safety is a chicken. At stake is your life and your reputation; if you swerve out of the way to save your life, you are a chicken.</p>

<p>Donating to charity is similar, in that if you donate you lose money, but if you don't donate you risk the charity not being able to effectively do its job. Hence people who donate are chickens.</p>

<p>But it gets worse.</p>

<p>Whether or not you donate has to do with your risk aversion and your percieved risk aversion of every other potential donator. In Chicken you swerve because you believe the other driver won't swerve; when you donate you do so because you believe that without you not enough other people will donate. So the less you believe that other people will donate, the more you believe you have to. This gets drastically worse the more people are playing the game.</p>

<p>When Wikipedia asks for donations, they do so by showing an ad to their millions of viewers. Even if you value Wikipedia and have money, millions of other people may have more money than you or may value wikipedia more than you. This means you have to believe a blisteringly small percentage of those will actually donate for it to be necessary for you to grab your wallet. Hence people who donate are pessimistic.</p>

<p>People who donate are pessimistic chickens.</p>

<h3>This sucks</h3>

<p>When you donate you should feel like you've done something good. Instead you feel beaten and ashamed. You're a sucker and you're pulling the deadweight that is everyone who didn't donate.</p>

<p>At this point, some people might be in strong disagreement. "I love donating", "I do it selflessly" and "It's about the giving". Good for you! Good for us! The world needs more people like you. Many great artists and inventors were supported by generous patrons like yourself. But even the most optimistic and upbeat people who say that must surely agree that not everyone feels that way, and not everyone ever will.</p>

<p>So it remains the fact that a large number of us don't donate, or feel miserable donating, because donating is a game for pessimistic chickens.</p>

<h3>Winning a game of chicken with Pre-commitment</h3>

<p>Now that we know that donating is a game of chicken, we can see how to solve this game. A known strategy for winning Chicken is Pre-Commitment. An example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)#Pre-commitment">Pre-commitment</a> in the case of chicken with cars is:</p>

<blockquote>if one party were to ostentatiously disable their steering wheel just before the match, the other party would be compelled to swerve</blockquote>

<p>How can we apply this to donations? Well the aim of the game isn't to get something for free, it's to raise funds for the charity fairly from the people who value it. So if in the opening example, Bob and I equally value Wikipedia, it would be fair if we donate equally. So pre-commitment in this case would be if I said "I will donate $50 <em>only</em> if you also donate $50". This changes things.</p>

<p>Originally Bob had to evaluate the risk of Wikipedia closing down with the cost of losing $100. Now he gets to evaluate the risk of Wikipedia closing down with the cost of losing $50. The downside of donating just got smaller. But what if there weren't two people being asked this question, but 10 people? Remember the more people you know there are, the more pessimistic you have to be to think the risk of Wikipedia closing down is likely.</p>

<p>Well, if there are 10 people asked to donate, a fair thing I could do is say I will donate $10 <em>only</em> if I'm matched by $90 dollars. Bob now sees the problem as: $90 needs to be donated and then the remaining $10 will be unlocked. Bob may follow my lead and say he'll donate $10 if $90 is donated. If all 10 of us did the same thing, we would all be in agreement with donating $10 each. Hence Wikipedia would receive $100 in donations fairly drawn from the 10 of us.</p>

<p>All this happened because instead of being a pessimistic chicken, I became an aggressive extorter.</p>

<h3>A Case "Study"</h3>

<p>Of course in reality it's not as simple and straight forward as that. You might not be Wikipedia, you instead be a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/CaspianReport">somewhat successful youtuber with a Patreon page</a> and instead of asking for $100 you're asking for as much as people are willing to pay. Ideally you'd get enough donations you could run your youtube channel as your full time job. As I write this, the CaspianReport has 335 patrons donating a total of $869 per report (a 10 minute video about geo-politics on the youtube account). That's an average of $2.60 per donor.</p>

<p>Note that the youtube account has 92K subscribers, and produces 3-5 videos a month with view counts between 50k and 300K depending on the topic. It's very hard to say how much the CaspianReport ought to be paid per video, however due to the reasons stated above I suspect less people are donating than could be.</p>

<p>Let's say that instead of 335 pessimistic chickens donating an average of $2.60, we have 335 aggressive extorters, who refused to donate their $2.60 each until $1000 per video is reached. The people who were formerly brave optimists (i.e. non-donors) are now presented with a different problem: for every $1 you donate up to $131, $6.63 will be matched, at which point a total of $1000 will be donated.</p>

<p>We calculate this as 1000-869 = 131 to be reached, with 869 spread out over the 131, or 869/131 = 6.63.</p>

<p>At this point, donating becomes much more enticing. Not only are you getting more bang for your buck when you donate, but socially you feel like you're cooperating with other people, not making up for them.</p>

<p>Also in reality you wouldn't have 335 people all picking $1000 as a target, you'd have some of them picking $50 as a target, some of them $100, some $200, etc, up to and beyond $1000.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Effectively what we've done, is given people who wouldn't have donated before an alternative to not donating. A person's choices have gone from donate or not donate, to donate, not donate, or hold money hostage to encourage others to donate. We've created liquitity and made donating something that doesn't leave you feeling beaten and ashamed, but victorious and proud. You'll be able to truthfully say:</p>

<blockquote>"My donation helped encourage another $100 to be donated!"</blockquote>
