		<h1> The Meme Free Market </h1>
		<p class=abstract>This is a counter argument to The Guardian's article on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/political-memes-2016-election-hillary-clinton-donald-trump">Meme Warfare</a>, the usage of memes to advance one's personal beliefs, sometimes dishonestly, into the public discussion. I counter the argument by likening meme warfare to cutthroat competitive business practices.</p>

<p>Previously I promised a post on modern monetary theory but I'm hesitant to write a summary that's wrong, so I've been delaying writing that. Instead here's something stupid.</p>

<h3>The Free Market</h3>

<p>The free market is some magical force that optimizes for efficiency, according to some people. Whether or not that's true, the beauty of it is that it allows for all the independent agents within it to be greedy and self serving, with the claim that the total composition of all the agents will be for the betterment of all involved. A beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition">fallacy of composition</a>.</p>

<h3>Memes</h3>

<p>Memes are units of culture. I've not heard anyone say this but perhaps you could say that the summation of all living memes in a community is that community's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a>. Memes live when they are being shared and die when they are not, basically what Terry Pratchett says in Going Postal:</p>

<blockquote>Do you not know that a man is not dead while his name is still spoken?</blockquote>

<h3>The Meme Free Market</h3>

<p>What I'd like to propose in this post is the Meme Free Market. We said that the Free Market is a collection of selfish individuals whose collective actions are almost altruistic. Similarly I believe, the Meme Free Market is composed of individuals each trying to share what they believe to be true which results in a zeitgeist that converges on the truth. I believe that this holds even when the individuals aren't correct.</p>

<p>I say this because people let go of ideas they no longer believe, no matter how much they'd rather that scenario. An atheist who thinks heaven would be a lovely place can't suddenly start believing in it. They have to be convinced, not tempted. So as people encounter memes, the ones that live will be the ones that ring true. This is similar to how in the Free Market the businesses that survive are the ones that are profitable.</p>

<h3>An Example - #DraftOurDaughters</h3>

<p>The hashtag <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/draftourdaughters">"DraftOurDaughters"</a>:</p>

<blockquote>is a satirical social media hashtag launched by supporters of Donald Trump which encourages American women to register for Selective Service in preparation for hypothetical scenarios of United States military operations that would supposedly be launched by Hillary Clinton if she were elected as president of the United States.</blockquote>

<p>This was spawned out of Hillary Clinton's stance in favor of a Syria no-fly zone which has been suggested by many to likely trigger a war with Russia. This wont be a political post, so I'll only be addressing how the DraftOurDaughters meme fits into the Meme Free Market, not whether it's accurate, or whether Clinton's policy is a good or bad thing.</p>

<p>The meme itself is simultaneously deceitful and honest. It lies about being an official Clinton ad but it's honest about what its creators believe. The meme itself has strong emotional appeal, implying the risking of the lives of American citizens should Clinton be elected. When a person first encounters the meme they are, due to the strength of the evoked emotions, forced to confront the implications of Clinton's policy. They may or may not reach the conclusion that a no-fly policy is dangerous but at least they'll think about it.</p>

<p>Contrast this with when Clinton mentioned her no-fly zone in the presidential debate (I think it was the third debate). You might not even remember the moment because the discussion quickly moved on. People not paying much attention to the debate may have had the moment slip right by them. In this sense I think DraftOurDaughters does a better job than the official debate at getting the significance of the idea out there.</p>

<h3>But is this right?</h3>

<p>A natural reaction to a public discussion overtly subverted by memes would be horror. The misinformation! Clinton didn't actually create ads encouraging women to join the military in preparation for war with Russia! That's true but this is why I've likened "meme warfare" to the free market.</p>

<p>If I try to steal your customers from your business in the free market by offering lower prices, that takes potential income away from you. However "rude" that may have been of me, you could always return fire by undercutting me in return, or by producing a higher quality product. In the Meme Free Market DraftOurDaughters could be countered with an opposing meme. I'm not a particularly proficient memester but an example counter meme might be something like DontAbandonSyrians. Whether or not that would counter DraftOurDaughters is as interesting as wether or not you could undercut me in our hypothetical business warfare. The point is, all's far in meme warfare.</p>

<h3>Is this new?</h3>

<p>The idea of a collective conciousness that "thinks" through us humans debating each other isn't new. The point of this post was to make the argument that the dirty tactics of "meme warfare" are of similar moral calibre as the dirty tactics of competitive businesses. Monopolies are bad but just about everything else is actually to the benefit of society.</p>
