			Blog Levels
		</h1>
		<p class="abstract">This post covers Blog Levels and how I'll use them to better signal which posts are worth reading to you.</p>

<p>One of the first things I noticed after I made this blog was that I started to discard certain topics as not "blog worthy". I sometimes have half baked thoughts and I wouldn't want people reading this to get turned away from my more interesting content just because they had to sleuth through mounds of crap.</p>

<p>But I immediately resisted censoring my less developed or interesting thoughts. The whole point of the blog is to put my ideas on display and further develop the ideas with maybe the help of a helpful reader. So I'm going to add a Blog Level for each post I make.</p>

<h3>A what?</h3>

<p>A Blog Level is a moronic pun on Log Levels in programming. The levels typically look like this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Debug</li>
	<li>Info</li>
	<li>Warning</li>
	<li>Error</li>
	<li>Fatal</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, programmer log levels have a pessimistic angle. They only really care about things that went wrong. Hopefully my blog wont only be about things going wrong so I'll be using a different set for my Blog Levels:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Mundane</li>
	<li>Half-baked or Boring</li>
	<li>Interesting</li>
	<li>Very Interesting</li>
	<li>Important or "Action" required</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure I'll stick with those names but for now I think they convey the idea. The first four are self-explanatory, although definitely subjective. The last one will be reserved for things that affect how you consume this blog. So my previous opening post is a 4, because I think it's very interesting, but this post is a 5 because it tells you how to interpret Blog Levels. I'm anticipating most posts being a 3, with 2s and 4s interspersed, and 5s being increasingly rare as I develop a stable routine for this blog. I'll try and spare you from 1s but I won't make promises I can't keep.</p>
