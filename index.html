 In this post we explore why some people are discouraged from donating and how we can turn this around to encourage people to donate using a form of pre-commitment.

 In reading
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">
  Antifragile
 </a>
 it&#39;s seemed that the concept relates to software and programming in many ways, including language design, testing, bug bounties and project management.

						A Book I'd Like to Read: Evolution Wars

				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 I was reading about
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber-toothed_cat#Biology">
  Saber-toothed cats
 </a>
 , as you do, and was interested in how saber tooths were a case of convergent evolution, and one cat would typically fill the hole left by a previously extinct saber tooth predecessor. It makes growing saber teeth seem like a strategy, which in a co-evolution context has positive and negative trade offs. The sequence of strategies employed by species against each other sound like they&#39;d make an interesting book. So I&#39;d like to describe in a little more detail what I&#39;d like in the book.

 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">
  Pareto Efficiency
 </a>
 is a notion that&#39;s helpful in discriminating between different allocations of resources. Political discussions are typically about moral stances and resource allocations, many of which are trade offs, e.g. coal miner jobs versus climate change. As such, terminology from the notion of Pareto Efficiency are well suited for discussing and reasoning about political dilemmas..

						Review to View

				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 Aggregator sites like reddit and hackernews are a valuable feature of the internet. They provide a single location for a reader to find all sorts of news articles on the web. One thing they do poorly, however, is provide a valuable signal to noise ratio. In this article I propose a crowd sourced technique for improving that which I call Review to View.

				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 Publicly trading companies allows the market better invest in them. This allows a company to more readily raise investments and creates price signals regarding the relative worth of companies. What if we could do the same for employees? Should we do the same employees? I think it could potentially help fund education and is worth consideration.

				<p class="abstract">
 Gaining a critical mass of users for a web-app is incredibly difficult. Many good web-apps likely die as infants before they&#39;ve truely had the chance to demonstrate their worth. I propose commodotising test users to make reaching that critical mass less ruled by chance.

 What do iPhones, Bitcoin Wallets, and Java interfaces have in common? They all enrich their networks with super powers. Or atleast, bitcoins might eventually.

 I&#39;ve been thinking for a while now that there are similarities between economics and programming. One more similarity that I want to write about is market code smells.

						Department of Memes

				</h3>
				<p class="abstract">
 The need for openness and accessibility has made walled cities are a thing of the past. How then are our societies to protect themselves? I propose a new government department, the Department of Memes (as in Dawkins, not cat pictures). This new department would have the responsibility of monitoring memes, or popular cultural attitudes, and studying their origins and behavior. Not only would this be a powerful tool for improving safety but I think it has many other benefits that alone justify its existence.

 The Reputation Economy, more commonly referred to as the

 , is thought to be a next big thing but little thought is put into the technology required to make it work. In this post I argue that more focus needs to be given to Reputation Technologies in order for Reputation Economies to develop.
