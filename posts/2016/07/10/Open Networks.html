		<h1> Open Networks </h1>
		<p class=abstract>I examine the network effect, how examples of networks exploit it, examples that don't, and suggest we ought to care if our networks are open.</p>

<p>I've been thinking that there ought to be a word or term to describe a kind of network that I think isn't that common on the web. If you imagine Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, Paypal, or things like that, they form a network or users. In the first three examples the users create the content. In the final example, Paypal, to an extent the users are more like targets. Things are done to them, i.e. they are given or billed money.</p>

<p>Each of these networks are dependant on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">Network Effect</a>.</p>

<blockquote>the effect that one user of a good or service has on the value of that product to other people.</blockquote>

<p>This is sometimes also used to refer to Network Lock in. Google+ is useless without the users. Even if you think it has better features, is faster, looks nicer, whatever, if your friends aren't on there it's useless. Youtube would fair a little better without its videos. You can still upload to share your videos just fine, even if there isn't much to look at besides what you just uploaded. Reddit is useless without the users submitting stories and voting/curating the content. And Paypal is less useful without websites having a "Pay with Paypal" button. All of these networks are to one degree or another reliant on the network effect, on the value created by users joining and participating in their network.</p>

<h3>Lock In</h3>

<p>There are two problems with this. The first is Lock in. As mentioned above, you won't migrate to Google+ from Facebook unless your friends are on there. Likewise your friends won't migrate. Thus you're stuck with everyone staying on Facebook. This is anti competitive. Innovation of features will stagnate if Facebook can trust that people won't leave them because of network Lock In.</p>

<p>The Indie Web folks refer to this as <a href="https://indieweb.org/plurality">Plurality</a>.</p>

<h3>Where's my cut?</h3>

<p>You create value by participating in the network, but Facebook et al are the ones who profit? That doesn't seem right. I created the value by uploading my video to Youtube and by curating content on Reddit. After the platform provider takes their share for hosting costs, I should get to take my share too.</p>

<h3>An Open Network</h3>

<p>Email allows me to use which ever email client I wish. I can use which ever phone or network carrier to talk to people. So in that sense these networks are Open and competitive. This is enabled via standardisation of the email protocol, SMTP.</p>

<p>It's harder to think of an example of a network that reimburses its members for their contribution. You could say a government rewards its tax paying citizens by providing them with public services. A sporting club with a membership fee provides its members with the fields, courts, equipment, etc, that are necessary to play the sport. StackOverflow rewards its members with increased privileges. It's harder to say what enables these networks to give back to their members, it seems to be done on a network-by-network basis.</p>

<p>I'd like to call a network that does this an Open Network, if it hasn't already been named. This is inspired by how source code you can access and contribute to is called Open Source.</p>

<p>It's always said that competition is good, it leads to innovation, high quality of service, etc. And it's also said, "If you're not paying, you're the product". In light of this we should not be satisfied with using uncompetitive networks relying on unrewarded contributions. If you've ever asked if your chicken was free-range, your coffee fair trade, your fish sustainably caught, your energy fossile fuel neutral or in other ways cared about what you were contributing to with your wallet or time, I'd love for you to also ask if your web app uses an open network.</p>
